# Monstertorium

Node Server & API

This is a [WIP] Node.js project. I am building and testing a Node server and API on top of a cloned repository which renders the 'monster' assets.

This project does not include a database. I am building a separate Node server and API with a PostgreSQL database and React front end.

The test suite features Mocha, Chai and SuperTest. [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) is a Super-agent driven library for testings Node.js HTTP servers using a fluent API.
